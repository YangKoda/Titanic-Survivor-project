# React App Setup Guide

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to clone, set up, and run the React application using npm.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Git for Windows (Download from: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
- Node.js (Download from: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- npm (comes installed with Node.js)

## Cloning the Repository

1. Open Command Prompt or Git Bash.
2. Clone the repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/username/project-name.git` with the actual URL of the repository.
3. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

## Installing Dependencies

Inside the project directory, run the command to install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, execute:
```bash
npm start
```
This command starts the development server usually on `http://localhost:3000/`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the app.

## Additional Commands

- To build the app for production, run:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- To run tests, execute:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

Follow these steps to set up and run your React application on a Windows environment. For more specific project details or additional npm scripts, refer to the `package.json` file in the project directory.
